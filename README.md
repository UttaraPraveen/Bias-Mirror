# 🪞 Bias Mirror

**See your thoughts from every angle.**

Bias Mirror is an AI-powered reflection tool that helps users uncover how perspective, framing, and cognitive bias shape meaning. Instead of debating opinions, it gently refracts them—revealing hidden assumptions, alternative viewpoints, and ethical implications using structured multi-perspective reasoning.

Built with **Google Gemini**, Bias Mirror is designed to promote self-awareness, empathy, and critical thinking without judgment.

## ✨ What Bias Mirror Does

Given a single belief or opinion, Bias Mirror performs a structured analysis that includes:

### 🔍 Neutral Reframe
Rewrites the original statement in an emotionally balanced, neutral tone to clarify its core meaning.

### 👥 Multi-Perspective Analysis
Reframes the same idea through four distinct lenses:

- **👤 Affected Individual** — How the statement may impact those directly involved  
- **⚖️ Authority / Expert** — A leadership or decision-making viewpoint  
- **🌍 Societal Impact** — Broader cultural and systemic implications  
- **🧭 Ethical Lens** — Moral considerations, fairness, and long-term effects  

### 🪞 The Bias Mirror
A respectful counter-perspective written as if by an intelligent person who strongly disagrees—designed to challenge assumptions without confrontation.

### 🧠 Cognitive Bias Tagging
Automatically identifies relevant cognitive biases and framing effects (e.g., Confirmation Bias, Framing Effect) influencing perception.

## 🧠 Why Bias Mirror?

Most AI tools focus on *answers*.  
Bias Mirror focuses on **understanding**.

It is not a debate engine or fact-checker—it is a reflection tool that helps users pause, reconsider, and see their own thinking more clearly.
