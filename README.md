# Bias-Mirror

🪞 Bias Mirror
See your biases reflected. Shift your view.

The Bias Mirror is an AI-powered cognitive tool designed to help users uncover hidden complexity in their opinions. By leveraging Google's Gemini models, it acts as a "prism" for thought—taking a singular opinion and refracting it through multiple objective lenses to promote empathy, systems thinking, and self-reflection.

✨ Features
Neutral Reframe: Strips away emotional loading to reveal the core factual claim of an opinion.

Multi-Perspective Analysis: Instantly generates viewpoints from four distinct angles:

👤 Affected Individual: Emotional impact on those targeted.

⚖️ Authority/Expert: How a leader or subject matter expert might view the challenge.

🌍 Societal Impact: Long-term ripple effects if the opinion were universal.

🧭 Ethical Lens: The moral and fairness implications.

The "Bias Mirror": A compassionate, counter-intuitive "What if?" scenario designed to gently challenge the user's assumption.

Cognitive Bias Tagging: Automatically detects and labels logical fallacies (e.g., Confirmation Bias, Slippery Slope).

Modern SaaS UI: Built with a clean, glassmorphism-inspired interface using Tailwind CSS.
